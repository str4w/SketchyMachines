Some thoughts on rendering
Primitive pic does both additive and subtractive color mixing, i.e. it can both brighten and darken - this is not 
how ink works.  Cost function is also some type of mean squares, maybe this is not the best.

Need to set up an optimizer like this, but with both different constraints on drawing, different types of cost
function, and guided search.
